Here's an explanation of how the code works:

The code uses Cypress to write automated tests for the TVO Learn website.  
The beforeEach block visits the TVO Learn website before each test.  
The first test checks if the homepage loads correctly.  
The second test navigates to the "Learning Resources (K-12)" dropdown and checks if it exists.  
The third test chooses a random grade level between 1 and 12 and checks if the selection is successful.  
The fourth test scrolls down to the "Learn Forward in the Curriculum" section and checks if it's visible.  
The fifth test clicks on any card within that section representing subjects and verifies that the click action is successful.  
The sixth test clicks on any card within that section representing subjects and validates that clicking on a subject card navigates to the corresponding subject page.  
The seventh test checks if subject title, description, and resources are visible on the subject page.  
The eighth test chooses a random grade level between 1 and 12 and checks that the selected grade level is correctly displayed on the subject page.  
The ninth test checks if subject cards are visible on the subject page.  
The tenth test clicks on any card within that section representing subjects and verifies that clicking on a subject card navigates to the corresponding subject page.
